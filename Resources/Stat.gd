#@tool # To clamp values when editing stats in the editor. # WARNING: This is causing errors on editor launch because of the GameState signal access. It doesn't seem to provide much usage benefit, so it's disabled instead of using a potentially expensive `Engine.is_editor_hint()` check during each change.

## The current value of the stat. Clamped between [member min] and [member max].
## NOTE: The default initial value is set equal to [member min].
@export var value: int = min: # DESIGN: Default to `min` because it is almost always 0, but `max` is usually different for most Stats, which causes a redundant `value` change from the default `max` of 10 to the new `max`.
	set = setValue # Use a separate function for the property setter so that it may be overridden in subclasses. The getter should not be overridden as that causes problems in cases like `value = value - 1` etc.

## Logs changes.
## WARNING: May reduce performance if used for very frequently-changing stats.
