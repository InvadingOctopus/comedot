## An [Upgrade] represents a special collectible that grants a permanent or once-only effect, ability or item to a character,
## such as a player purchasing a new gun, or a monster getting a speed boost on a higher difficulty level.
## Upgrades may be upgraded multiple times and have costs associated with each enhancement,
## such as a gun getting a faster rate-of-fire, or a monster getting a strength buff after a certain time has elapsed.
## Upgrades may be acquired from in-game-world shops or even via in-app purchases,
## and the shop may inspect an [Entity]'s [UpgradesComponent] to keep track of which upgrades have already been purchased and not be offered again.
## NOTE: Even though this class is named "upgrade" it may also be used for downgrades/debuffs.

class_name Upgrade
extends Resource

# NOTE: Does not `extend StatDependentResourceBase` because instead of a single `cost`, there is an Array of `costs`, different for each `level`.

# TODO: Create a base superclass for general purchasable items.
# TBD:  Create an emtpy subclass called "Downgrade" for naming consistency? :P
# TBD:  Should `acquire` be renamed `install`?


#region Parameters

## NOTE: This name MUST BE UNIQUE across all Upgrades, because [UpgradesComponent] and other classes search Upgrades by their names.

	set(newValue):
		if newValue.is_empty():
			Debug.printWarning("Rejected attempt to set name to empty string")
			return
		name = newValue

## An optional different name for displaying in the HUD and other UI. If empty, returns [member name] capitalized.
@export var displayName: String:
	get:
		if not displayName.is_empty(): return displayName
		else: return self.name.capitalize()

## The core functionality of this Upgrade. A [Payload] to execute when this Upgrade is "installed" or "uninstalled" on an [Entity]'s [UpgradesComponent].
## See [Payload] for explanation and available options.
@export var payloadOnAcquire: Payload

## A [Payload] to execute when this Upgrade is removed from an [Entity]'s [UpgradesComponent].

@export var payloadOnDiscard: Payload

@export var description: String ## An optional explanation, for internal development notes or to show the player.
@export var shouldShowDebugInfo: bool = false


@export_group("Level")

## The upgrade level of this Upgrade. Some upgrades may be upgraded multiple times to make them more powerful.
## If this value is set higher than [member maxLevel] and [member shouldAllowInfiniteLevels] is false, then it is reset to [member maxLevel].
@export_range(0, 100, 1, "or_greater") var level: int:
	set(newValue):

		# Keep the level at or under maxLevel.

		level = newValue # Set the value first before emitting signals in case the handlers need to check it.

		if level > previousValue:
			didLevelUp.emit()
			if not shouldAllowInfiniteLevels and level >= maxLevel: didMaxLevel.emit()
		elif level < previousValue:
			didLevelDown.emit()

## The maximum number of times this Upgrade may be upgraded. Ignored if [member shouldAllowInfiniteLevels] is true.
## A value of <= -1 is invalid.

			level = maxLevel

## If `true` then [member maxLevel] is ignored and [member level] has no limit.
@export var shouldAllowInfiniteLevels: bool = false


@export_group("Costs")

## The [Stat] required to "pay" for the Upgrade, such as spending Money at a shop or Energy at a machine.
## If no Stat is specified, then the Upgrade is always free.
## NOTE: If a Stat is specified but not present in an Entity's [StatsComponent], the Upgrade CANNOT be purchased EVEN IF the cost is <= 0.
## This acts as a further layer of validation: The Entity must have the Stat type in its StatsComponent, i.e. be able to HOLD a resource such as gold etc., but it may be 0.
## NOTE: This actual [Stat] is never used for comparison when searching in a [StatsComponent], ONLY THE NAME.
## Searching by the name allows any Entity, even monsters etc. to use Upgrades, by having different instances of the same Stat resource.
## DESIGN: This parameter accepts a [Stat] to eliminate bugs from typing incorrect names, and to be able to use the [member Stat.displayName].
@export var costStat: Stat

## This is the property that is ACTUALLY used to search for the required Stat, so that ANY instance of a particular Stat resource may be usable.
var costStatName: StringName:
	get: return self.costStat.name if self.costStat else &""

## A list of costs for each [member level] of this upgrade. The first cost at array index 0 is the requirement for initially acquiring this upgrade.
## `cost[n]` == Level n+1 so `cost[1]` == Upgrade Level 2.
## If a cost is <= 0, or missing and [member shouldUseLastCostForHigherLevels] is false, then the level is free.
## If the array is empty, then the Upgrade is always free.
## TIP: Use [member shouldUseLastCostForHigherLevels] to specify only 1 or a few costs and use the last cost for all subsequent levels.
@export_range(0, 1000, 1, "or_greater") var costs: Array[int]

## If `true`, then the highest index of the [member costs] array is used for all subsequent higher levels.
## This lets you write only 1 or a few costs even if the number of allowed upgrade levels is higher.
@export var shouldUseLastCostForHigherLevels: bool = false


@export_group("Requirements")

## An optional list of other upgrades which are needed before this upgrade may be used.
## This array is checked in order.
@export var requiredUpgrades: Array[Upgrade]

## An optional list of upgrades which prevent this upgrade from being acquired or used.
## For example, if the player has a fire-based weapon, they may not equip a water-based weapon.
## This array is checked in order.
## NOTE: This is an Array of [StringName] instead of [Upgrade], because 2 Upgrades referring to each other would cause a cyclic dependency, preventing Godot from loading them. :')
@export var mutuallyExclusiveUpgrades: Array[StringName]

## An optional list of [Component]s that this Upgrade requires or modifies, such as a [GunComponent].
## This array is checked in order.
# TODO: @export var requiredComponents: Array[Component] # GODOT LIMITATION: "Node export is only supported in Node-derived classes, but the current class inherits 'Resource'." :(
