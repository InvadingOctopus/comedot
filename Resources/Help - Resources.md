The `/Resources/` folder is for the base scripts & classes for the `.tres` "Resources" to be built from.

To create the actual shareable Resources, right-click on a folder in the FileSystem Dock and choose **Create New** â†’ **Resource**.

For example, the `Stat.gd` Script can be used to make a `Health.tres` Resource that may then be used in a `StatsComponent`.
