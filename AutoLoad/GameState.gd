## [StringName] is the optimal type to use for keys.

## The list of active players.
## WARNING: Do NOT modify this property directly; use [method addPlayer] and [method removePlayer] instead.
## NOTE: To avoid a crash when there is no player, access the first player with `players.front()` NOT `player[0]`.

## A dictionary of stats and values to display in the HUD UI.
## Changes to the dictionary should emit the `hudUpdated` signal which may be used by UI nodes to efficiently update themselves only when stats change.
