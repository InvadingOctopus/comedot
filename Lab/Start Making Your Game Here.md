# Comedot - Lab Folder

Make the initial prototype scenes for your game here.

When you are ready to begin a full project,
create a new branch for your game, like "game-yourgamename",
and organize your game's files into the existing Comedot folder structure,
like `/Assets/YourGame/`, `/Scenes/YourGame/` etc.

This keeps the framework code and resources separate from your game's,
and also lets you use a separate git repository for your game.
