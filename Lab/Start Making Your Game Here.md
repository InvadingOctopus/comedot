# Comedot - Lab Folder

Make the initial prototype scenes/scripts for your game here.

This folder should be for temporary files only and ignored by git.

When you are ready to begin a full project,
create a new branch for your game, like "game-yourgamename",
and organize your game's files into the existing Comedot folder structure,
like `/Assets/YourGame/`, `/Scenes/YourGame/`, or `/YourGame/etc/`

This keeps the framework code and resources separate from your game's,
and also lets you use a separate git repository for your game.
