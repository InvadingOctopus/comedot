# Comedot - Game Folder

Make the initial prototype scenes/scripts for your game here.

When you are ready to begin a full project,
create a new branch for your game e.g. "game-yourgamename" within the Comedot repository,
and organize your game's files into the existing Comedot folder structure,
like `/Assets/YourGame/`, `/Scenes/YourGame/`,
or you can make a separate master folder for your game-specific files only: `/YourGame/Assets/`, `/YourGame/Player/`, etc.

This keeps the framework code and shared resources separate from your game's,
preventing your game code from being overwritten by Comedot updates,
and also lets you use a separate git repository within your game subfolder.
