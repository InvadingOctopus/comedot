# Contributing to Comedot

* The best and easiest way to improve Comedot is to submit components: Did you make a component for your own game that could be reused in other games? Give it here! For example, a bullet that explodes into other bullets, or a specific pattern of movement on a grid map in a turn-based game, and so on.

* Check the [ToDo.md][todo] to see where you could help out, though that file is not always updated, so search the source code for `TODO:` or `FIXME:` etc. comments to see exactly what's missing and where.

* See [Conventions.md][conventions] for a rough style guide and other coding conventions that this project tries to follow.

* If you have an idea, suggestion, code or any other contribution, open a new issue or pull request on the [Comedot repository][repository].
