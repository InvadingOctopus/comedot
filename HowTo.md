# Comedot - How To Do Basic Stuff

## Your Main Game Scene

* Must have the `/Scripts/Start.gd` script attached to the root node (or any other node as long as it runs before other scripts, just to be safe) so it can initialize the Comedot framework environment and flags etc.

## Make a Player Entity

1. Create a `CharacterBody2D` node.
2. Attach the `/Entities/Characters/PlayerEntity.gd` script.
3. Add other necessary nodes like `Sprite2D` or `AnimatedSprite2D`, `CollisionShape2D`, `Camera2D` etc and set them up.
4. Remember to set the Physics Collision Layer to `players` and set the Mask to `terrain` at least.

* üí° You can use a template like `/Templates/Entities/PlayerEntityTemplate.tscn`

### Add Player Control and Movement

1. Select the Player Entity.

2. Choose `Instantiate Child Scene` from the context menu.

3. Add components from `/Components/Control/` as children of the Entity node, like `OverheadControlComponent`

* üí° Read the documentation comments in the scripts of each component to see how to use it.

* ‚ùï If you add the `PlatformerControlComponent` then you should also add the `JumpControlComponent` and `/Components/Physics/GravityComponent`

## Add Combat

1. Add a `FactionComponent` and set the Faction to either `players` or `enemies`

2. Add a `HealthComponent`

3. Add a `DamageReceivingComponent`

* For monsters, add a `DamageComponent` to hurt the player on contact.

* ‚ùï Remember to set the correct Physics Collision Layers and Masks for everything, otherwise they will not register collisions with each other.

* üí° For the player, you may also add an `InvulnerabilityOnHitComponent`.
