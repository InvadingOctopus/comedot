# Comedot for the Godot Asset Library

A project template and framework for making 2D games by adding components to entities. Includes a library of components for common tasks like player movement and combat, helper functions, UI, and free-to-use 3rd-party assets for prototyping. May be combined with any other framework or architecture.

This is a work in progress. For more deets and the latest version, lookie loo the Develop branch on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/InvadingOctopus/comedot/tree/develop

ALERT: The first time you load this project, there may be errors/glitches because Godot will re-import the asset files and change the IDs for textures etc. Close and reopen the project. You may need to manually update the "/Templates/TileSetTemplate.tres" tileset to re-add the texture: "/Assets/Images/Checkerboard32x32.png" (but do not automatically recreate the tiles).
