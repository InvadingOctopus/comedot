# Comedot - Your Games Folder

Make a subfolder in `/Games` with your game's name,
and use that for all files and assets related to your game.

This keeps the framework code and resources separate from your game's,
which also lets you use a separate git repository for your game.

You may mirror the Comedot folder tree structure under your game's folder,
such as `/YourGame/Assets`, `/YourGame/Entities`, `/YourGame/Components` etc.
