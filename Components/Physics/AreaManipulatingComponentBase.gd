## Base class for components which depend on an [Area2D].
## The [Component] or its parent [Entity] ITSELF may BE an [Area2D] node, or a different [Area2D] that already exists may be specified.

class_name AreaManipulatingComponentBase
extends Component

# TBD: Better name? :')
# DESIGN: Do not connect signals here; specific signals should only be connected in specific subclasses when they are needed, to improve performance.


#region Parameters
## A specific [Area2D] to use. If unspecified, then this Component is used if it itself is an [Area2D] node, otherwise [member Entity.area] is used.
@export var areaOverride: Area2D
#endregion


#region State
var area: Area2D ## The actual [Area2D] in use.

		if not selfAsArea: selfAsArea = self.get_node(^".") as Area2D

func _enter_tree() -> void:
	self.area = self.areaOverride

	# DESIGN: A Component as Area2D should override the Entity as Area2D, because a Component is an explicit addition to an Entity.

	# If no override is specified, first, try using this Component itself as an Area2D
	if not self.area:
