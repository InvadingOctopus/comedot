## NOTE: This should be a NEGATIVE value because a positive Y axis value means downwards.

## A shorter maximum velocity for the 1st jump if the player releases the Jump button quickly.
## NOTE: This should be a NEGATIVE value because a positive Y axis value means downwards.

## The velocity of the 2nd and later jumps.
## NOTE: This should be a NEGATIVE value because a positive Y axis value means downwards.

## Allows a "grace period" to let the player to jump just after walking off a platform floor.
## This may provide a better feel of control in some games.
## Named after Wile E. Coyote from Road Runner :>

## The "grace period" for allowing the player to jump just after walking off a platform floor.

## NOTE: This should be a NEGATIVE value because a positive Y axis value means downwards.

## The force with which the player bounces away horizontally from the wall during a wall jump.

## The "grace period" for allowing the player to jump just after leaving a wall.
