## Represents an item that may be picked up by a character [Entity] which has a [CollectorComponent].
## Provides a "[Payload]" which may be a new child node that will be attached to the collector [Entity], or a script or [Callable] that will be executed by the [CollectorComponent], or a signal to be emitted.
##
## NOTE: DESIGN: By default, a [CollectibleComponent] starts with [member Area2D.monitoring] disabled, so it does not waste processing time.
## In the recommended convention, a [CollectorComponent] handles the collision, checks its own collection conditions (such as maximum health or ammo), then calls the [method requestToCollect] on the collectible.
## The collectible then handles its own conditions and removal if the collection is approved.
##
## TIP: Should be subclassed with game-specific logic in most cases.

class_name CollectibleComponent
extends Component

# NOTE: DESIGN: [CollectibleComponent]s shouldn't include code to perform the handling of collision/transfer etc.
# This component should only contain data about the collectible.
# The pickup process should be covered by a [CollectorComponent].


#region Parameters

## The actual gameplay effect of picking up this collectibe, where this [CollectibleComponent] is passed as the `source` for [method Payload.execute], and the [CollectorComponent]'s parent [Entity] is the `target`.
## See [Payload] for explanation and available options.

## Called by a [CollectorComponent].
## When a collision occurs, the [CollectorComponent] handles the event and checks the conditions for collection (such as maximum allowed health or remaining inventory space).
## If the collector wants to pick this item, this method is called,
## then this [CollectibleComponent] checks its own conditions (such as whether the item is ready to be picked up, e.g. a chopped tree or mined rock).
## If the transfer is successful, this [CollectibleComponent] may then remove itself from the scene, or it may choose to enter a cooldown recovery state.

## Called by a [CollectorComponent] to perform the collection of this [CollectibleComponent],
## by calling [method Payload.execute] and passing this [CollectibleComponent] as the `source` and the [CollectorComponent]'s parent [Entity] as the `target`.
## Returns: The result of [method Payload.execute] or `false` if the [member payload] is missing.
