## Stores a list of gameplay actions which an Entity such as the player character or an NPC may perform.
## The actions may cost a Stat Resource when used and may require a target to be chosen,
## such as a special skill/spell like "Fireball", or a trivial command like "Examine".
## To perform an Action in response to player control, use [ActionControlComponent].
## Requirements: [StatsComponent] to perform Actions which have a Stat cost.

#region Signals

## Emitted if the [Action] [member Action.requiresTarget] but a target has not been provided for [method perform].
## May be handled by game-specific UI to prompt the player to choose a target for the Action.
## NOTE: If an Action is to be performed via this component's [method perform] then this signal is emitted by the [ActionsComponent] ONLY; [signal Action.didRequestTarget] will NOT be emitted.
