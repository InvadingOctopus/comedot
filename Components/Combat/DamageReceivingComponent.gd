## Receives damage when this component's [Area2D] "hurtbox" collides with an attacker's [DamageComponent] "hitbox". The damage is passed to the parent entity's [HealthComponent].
## If both entities have a [FactionComponent] then damage is dealt only if the entities do not share any faction. If a [FactionComponent] is missing then damage is always dealt.
## ALERT: Set the appropriate [member CollisionObject2D.collision_layer] & [member CollisionObject2D.collision_mask] on each [Area2D] or the combat system may behave unexpectedly!
## NOTE: The default for both properties is the `combat` physics layer, but for player entities the layer should be `players` and the mask should be `enemies`, and vice versa for monsters.
## Requirements: This component must be an [Area2D] representing the "hurtbox", and the Entity must also have a [HealthComponent] (or subclass).

class_name DamageReceivingComponent
extends Component

# DESIGN:	[DamageReceivingComponent] should NOT monitor the physics: It is the passive object in relation to the attacker's [DamageComponent] which is the "active" object that initiates the combat and calls the damage processing code.
# DESIGN: PERFORMANCE: This component cannot use a separate [Area2D] because the combat system needs to casts an [Area2D] to a [DamageReceivingComponent].
# This may REDUCE performance but it ensures a self-contained-components workflow.
# NOTE:		Do NOT modify the `healthComponent.health` directly; use `healthComponent.damage()` to ensure that subclasses such as [ShieldedHealthComponent] may be able to intercept and redirect the damage.
# TBD:		Dynamically find co-components?


#region Parameters
@export var shouldRemoveEntityIfNoHealthComponent: bool = true ## Lets this component be usable without a [THealthComponent], as a single solution for basic gameplay and entities that don't need to have "health".

	set(newValue):
		isEnabled = newValue
		# Toggle the area too, to ensure that [DamageComponent] can re-detect us,
		# e.g. after an [InvulnerabilityOnHitComponent] ends.

		# NOTE: Cannot set flags directly because Godot error: "Function blocked during in/out signal."

#region Signals

## Emitted when the factions are opposing or there is friendly fire, EVEN if there is no [HealthComponent].
## NOTE: The [param amount] may NOT be the ACTUAL amount of "health" deducted, which depends on the implementation of [HealthComponent], if there are any healing effects or "shields" etc.
## TIP:  To monitor actual changes in entity's "health", connect to [HealthComponent] signals.
signal didReceiveDamage(damageComponent: DamageComponent, amount: int, attackerFactions: int)

## This signal is always raised when colliding with a [DamageComponent] even if the factions are friendly and no health is reduced.
