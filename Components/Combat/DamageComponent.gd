## Causes damage to when this component's [Area2D] "hitbox" collides with a [DamageReceivingComponent]'s "hurtbox", which then passes it on to the victim entity's [HealthComponent].
## If both entities have a [FactionComponent] then damage is dealt only if the entities do not share any faction.
## If a [FactionComponent] is missing then damage is always dealt.
## ALERT: Remember to set the proper [member CollisionObject2D.collision_layer] & [member CollisionObject2D.collision_mask] or the combat system may behave unexpectedly!
## The default for both properties is the `combat` physics layer, but for player entities the layer should be `players` and the mask should be `enemies`, and vice versa for monsters.
## TIP: For hazards such as pools of acid or lava that cause repeated damage as long as the victim remains in contact, use [DamageRepeatingComponent].
## TIP: For attacks such as poison arrows etc. that cause "lingering" damage over time, add a [DamageOverTimeComponent] to the victim entity.
## Requirements: This component must be an [Area2D] or connected to signals from an [Area2D] representing the "hitbox".

#region Parameters

## The amount of damage to cause to the target when this [DamageComponent] first collides with a [DamageReceivingComponent].
## Suitable for bullets and other nodes that disappear on a collision.
## This value may be set to 0 if another script is going to handle the signals and apply the damage.
@export_range(0, 1000, 1) var damageOnCollision: int = 1 # NOTE: Should this be an integer or float?

## Optional. The amount of damage to cause to the target for as long as this [DamageComponent] remains within the area of a [DamageReceivingComponent].
## Suitable for monsters or hazards and other nodes which remain in the scene after causing damage.
## NOTE: Damage-per-frame may be caused in the same frame in which a collision first happens.
@export_range(0, 1000) var damagePerSecond: float = 0 # NOTE: Should this be an integer or float?

## Should bullets from the same faction hurt?
@export var friendlyFire: bool = false

## Should the parent Entity be removed when this [DamageComponent]'s "hitbox" collides with a [DamageReceivingComponent]'s "hurtbox"?
## Useful for "bullet" entities (including arrows etc.) that must be blocked by all receivers.
## ALERT: This is performed EVEN WHEN there NO actual damage is applied! i.e. even when there are no opposing factions. So a player's bullet may get blocked by the player entity itself.
## TIP: To remove a "bullet" etc. ONLY when damage is actually applied (i.e. on collision between opposing factions), use [member removeEntityOnApplyingDamage] instead.
@export var removeEntityOnCollisionWithReceiver: bool = false

## Should the parent Entity be removed when this [DamageComponent] causes damage to a [DamageReceivingComponent] related to an opposing [FactionComponent]?
## Useful for "bullet" entities (including arrows etc.) that should NOT be blocked by the entity which fired them.
## Ignored if the combatants do not have opposing factions or friendly fire.
## TIP: To always remove a "bullet" etc. on ANY collision with a receiver, use [member removeEntityOnCollisionWithReceiver].
## WARNING: Do NOT set to `true` for persistent "hazards" like spikes or acid pools etc.
@export var removeEntityOnApplyingDamage: bool = false

@export var isEnabled: bool = true: ## Also effects [member Area2D.monitorable] and [member Area2D.monitoring]
	set(newValue):
		isEnabled = newValue
		# Toggle the area too, to ensure that [DamageComponent] can re-detect us,
		# e.g. after an [InvulnerabilityOnHitComponent] ends.

		# NOTE: Cannot set flags directly because Godot error: "Function blocked during in/out signal."

#endregion


#region State

## The "attacker" [Entity] that "initiated" the damage or fired the bullet etc. It may be the player entity, a monster, or a "hazard" like a pool of acid.
## Optional; may be used to handle various situations such as ignoring the collision of a bullet against the entity that fired the bullet (not currently implemented).
## NOTE: When applied to the [DamageComponent] of a "bullet" entity, this value is NOT the bullet entity: It's the entity that FIRED the bullet.
## If `null` on [method _ready], it is set to this component's [member parentEntity]
## @experimental
