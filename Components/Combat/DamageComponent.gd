## Causes damage to a [DamageReceivingComponent] which then passes it on to a [HealthComponent].
## Requirements: This component should be an [Area2D] node.

class_name DamageComponent
extends Component


#region Parameters

## The amount of damage to cause to the target when this [DamageComponent] first collides with a [DamageReceivingComponent].
## Suitable for bullets and other nodes that disappear on a collision.
## This value may be set to 0 if another script is going to handle the signals and apply the damage.
@export_range(0, 1000, 1) var damageOnCollision: int = 1 # NOTE: Should this be an integer or float?

## Optional. The amount of damage to cause to the target for as long as this [DamageComponent] remains within the area of a [DamageReceivingComponent].
## Suitable for monsters or hazards and other nodes which remain in the scene after causing damage.
## NOTE: Damage-per-frame may be caused in the same frame in which a collision first happens.
@export_range(0, 1000) var damagePerSecond: float = 0 # NOTE: Should this be an integer or float?

## Optional. A [DamageTimerComponent] to apply to the parent [Entity] of the target [DamageReceivingComponent].
@export var damageTimerComponent: DamageTimerComponent

## Should bullets from the same faction hurt?
@export var friendlyFire: bool = false

## Should the parent Entity be removed when this [DamageComponent] collides with a [DamageReceivingComponent]?
## Useful for bullets.
@export var removeEntityOnCollisionWithDamageReceiver: bool = false

@export var isEnabled: bool = true: ## Also effects [member Area2D.monitorable] and [member Area2D.monitoring]
	set(newValue):
		isEnabled = newValue
		# Toggle the area too, to ensure that [DamageComponent] can re-detect us,
		# e.g. after an [InvulnerabilityOnHitComponent] ends.

		# NOTE: Cannot set flags directly because Godot error: "Function blocked during in/out signal."
		set_deferred("monitorable", newValue)
		set_deferred("monitoring",  newValue)

#region State

## Returns this component as an [Area2D] node.

## A shortcut that returns the [FactionComponent] of the parent [Entity].

## A list of [DamageReceivingComponent]s currently in collision contact.
