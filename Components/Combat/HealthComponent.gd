#region Parameters

@export var health: Stat
@export var shouldRemoveEntityOnZero: bool = false ## Affected by [member isEnabled].

## If true, [member health] will not decrease (or increase, if the damage is negative) more than [member maximumHealthDamagePerHit] during a single call to [method damage].
## This may be used for objects or enemies that require a fixed number of hits to destroy, no matter what the "strength" of the gun or attack is.
@export var shouldClampHealthDamage: bool

## Limits the maximum amount of damage during a single call to [method damage] if [member HealthComponent.health] is true.
## NOTE: If this limit is NEGATIVE then only HEALING will be allowed.
@export var maximumHealthDamagePerHit: int

@export var isEnabled: bool = true

#region Signals

## A decrease is a negative [param difference], so this signal may be connected to the same function as [signal healthDidIncrease].
signal healthDidDecrease(difference: int)

## [param difference] is always positive, so this signal may be connected to the same function as [signal healthDidDecrease], which always has a negative [param difference].
signal healthDidIncrease(difference: int)

## May be less than zero.
signal healthDidZero

## May be greater than [member health].[member Stat.max].
