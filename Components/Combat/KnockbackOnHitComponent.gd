## Pushes the entity back when a [DamageReceivingComponent] takes damage.
## WARNING: The knockback may not be applied if [member PlatformerMovementParameters.shouldStopInstantlyOnFloor] or [member PlatformerMovementParameters.shouldStopInstantlyInAir] is `true`.
## Requirements: [CharacterBody2D], [DamageReceivingComponent]

class_name KnockbackOnHitComponent
extends CharacterBodyManipulatingComponentBase


#region Parameters

## The magnitude of the knockback. A scalar which multiplies the vector of the direction of the colliding [DamageComponent].
@export_range(0, 1000, 5) var knockbackForce: float = 150.0

## Any additional fixed vector to apply.
## For example, a slight jump when receiving damage in a platform game.
@export var additionalVector: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO

## If `true` then the entity's existing velocity is set to 0 before applying the knockback.
## This ensures that the knockback is always noticeable even if the player is moving at a high speed towards the damage source.
@export var shouldZeroCurrentVelocity: bool = true

@export var isEnabled: bool = true
@export var shouldShowDebugInfo: bool = false
